# AI Trading Debate Platform

ðŸš€ **AI Trading Debate Platform** is an interactive Streamlit web app where two AI agents (Bull and Bear) debate whether a stock is a good candidate for day trading, using real-time data, technical indicators, and news sentiment analysis powered by OpenAI's GPT models.

## Features

- **AI Debate:** Watch two AI agents (Bull and Bear) debate the merits and risks of day trading a stock.
- **Customizable Personalities:** Configure each agent's risk tolerance, style, and focus areas.
- **Real-Time Data:** Fetches live stock data, technical indicators (RSI, MACD, MAs, Bollinger Bands, ATR), and recent news.
- **News Sentiment Analysis:** Uses OpenAI LLM to analyze news headlines for bullish/bearish/neutral sentiment.
- **Debate Summary & Recommendation:** Generates a neutral summary and a final actionable trading recommendation.
- **Beautiful UI:** Modern, responsive design with clear message cards and copy-to-clipboard functionality.

2. **Choose a stock symbol** (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL).
3. **Configure agent personalities** (optional).
4. **Start the debate** and watch the agents analyze, counter, and summarize.
5. **View the final recommendation** and copy it for your notes.
